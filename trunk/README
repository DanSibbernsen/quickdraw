CSE467S Project QuickDraw

GUI
The GUI is implemented in Java, using TinyOS's PrintfClient and Apache Derby database.

Dependencies:
	TinyOS 2.1.0, /opt/tinyos-2.1.0/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar compiled and in the CLASSPATH
	JavaDB implementation of Apache Derby, found at http://developers.sun.com/javadb/downloads/index.jsp
	derby.jar from the above installation located in /usr/share/javadb/lib/derby.jar and in the CLASSPATH
	CLASSPATH must also contain the current directory '.'

Compiling:
	QuickD.java must be compiled before PrintfClient.java:
	javac QuickD.java
	javac PrintfClient.java

Once compiled the GUI must be started from the directory containing the class files, PrintfClient is the main class.
PrintfClient is started with the same arguments as the original PrintfClient supplied by TinyOS:
	java PrintfClient -comm serial@<port>:micaz

The first time the GUI is started it takes a few seconds to create a new embedded database and table to store the data.

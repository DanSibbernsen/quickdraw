CSE467S Project QuickDraw


Playing QuickDraw
Note that the calibration values are specific to the sensor boards, so whichever mote has the A2-3 board has to have the TOS_MOTE_ID 0, and board A1-2 has to have TOS_MOTE_ID 1.  The accelerometer readings are dependent on these calibrations.

Steps to play the game:
1) Put control mote onto programming board and plug programmming board into computer
2) Start up the GUI (see directions below)
3) Turn on both gun-motes (if not already done)
4) Hold the guns pointing downward for 1 second, waiting for an initial 'beep' that symbolizes you are in the start position.  If a beep does not happen, adjust the angle.
5) A "START" message will appear on the screen, recognizing that both gun-motes have checked in with the system and have received a START command.
6) Hold the motes in the same downward position for 3 additional beeps.
7) On the last beep, angle the mote from the downard position to a 90 degree angle (essentially, pointing at your opponent) and hold for .5 seconds
8) A beep will signify a fired packet.
9) The GUI will report the winner as well as the times (in milliseconds) of each mote.
10) To restart the game, merely go back to step 4!

In order to see the results of the game, you must start the GUI (see directions below).


GUI
The GUI is implemented in Java, using TinyOS's PrintfClient and Apache Derby database.

Dependencies:
	TinyOS 2.1.0, /opt/tinyos-2.1.0/support/sdk/java/tinyos.jar compiled and in the CLASSPATH
	JavaDB implementation of Apache Derby, found at http://developers.sun.com/javadb/downloads/index.jsp
	derby.jar from the above installation located in /usr/share/javadb/lib/derby.jar and in the CLASSPATH
	CLASSPATH must also contain the current directory '.'

Compiling:
	QuickD.java must be compiled before PrintfClient.java:
	javac QuickD.java
	javac PrintfClient.java

Once compiled the GUI must be started from the directory containing the class files, PrintfClient is the main class.
PrintfClient is started with the same arguments as the original PrintfClient supplied by TinyOS:
	java PrintfClient -comm serial@<port>:micaz

The first time the GUI is started it takes a few seconds to create a new embedded database and table to store the data.
